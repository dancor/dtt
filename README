dtt
- uses `fortune` to generate typing exercises by default
- stats are saved, but the analysis tools here don't do much yet
- add cooler generation stuff to train on specific problem areas
  - thinking about converting to haskell to ease that stuff

to use bkrd
- create numbered passages in ~/.bkrd/cur/{0..}
  - src/chunk.py is good for breaking up a long book into numbered passages
- echo 0 > ~/.bkrd/cur/num
- echo <max-num> > ~/.bkrd/cur/max
- you can have several book passage dirs and just link ~/.bkrd/cur to cur one
- sorry this setup is kind of ghetto right now.  todos:
  - don't require max to be manually specified
  - do chunking in real time, or simplify chunking process
